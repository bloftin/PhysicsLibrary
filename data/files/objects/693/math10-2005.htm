<p class="bodysmall">Artistic works traditionally carry significance beyond their
  physical beauty, but a new sculpture in the McAllister Building headquarters
  of the Penn State Department of Mathematics may carry that tradition to its
  limits. The stainless-steel work, a striking object of visual art, also is
  a mental portal to the fourth dimension, a teaching tool, a memorial to a graduate
  of the math department, and a reminder of the terrorist attacks of 11 September
  2001. The sculpture itself measures about six feet in every direction and is
  mounted on a granite base about three feet high in order to bring its center

     <p><span class="bodysmall">13 October
       2005</span>&mdash;The <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State</a> <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu">Department
       of Mathematics</a> will host an
       open house of its extensively renovated McAllister Building, featuring
       a dedication ceremony for a unique sculpture with deep mathematical significance
       on 21 October 2005 at the Penn State University Park campus. The event
       will begin at 3:30 p.m. with a ceremony to dedicate the &quot;Octacube&quot; sculpture
       in the first-floor atrium of McAllister Building, followed by an opportunity
       for participants to explore the renovated building until 5:00 p.m. No
       good rendering of any 4-dimensional object existed anywhere in the world
       before the Octacube, either in solid or virtual form, according to<strong> Adrian
       Ocneanu</strong>, the Penn State professor of mathematics who designed
       the sculpture.</p>
   <p>In addition to the events on 21 October, the mathematics department will
     host a mathematical talk on 20 October at 4:00 p.m. and a talk for the general
     public on 26 October at 6:00 p.m. All three events will take place in the
     atrium near the sculpture, will feature 4-dimensional movies, and will be
     open to the public at no charge.</p>

     <p class="caption">The sculpture measures about six feet in every
     direction and is mounted on a granite base about three feet high. <a href="#Sculpture">Click

   </div>The sculpture is a gift from<strong> Jill Grashof Anderson</strong>, a
     mathematics alumna of Penn State as a memorial for her husband,<strong> Kermit
     C. Anderson</strong>,
     also a Penn State mathematics graduate, who was killed in the terrorist
     attack on the World Trade Center in New York City on 11 September 2001.
     The dedication ceremony for the sculpture will include an explanation of
     its mathematical meaning by its designer, <strong>Adrian Ocneanu</strong>,
     professor of mathematics. Ocneanu is a mathematics researcher who works
     on models of Quantum Field Theory based on symmetry. He designed the sculpture
     as a research and teaching tool related to his research. The stainless-steel
     Octacube is a striking object of visual art and also a mental portal to
     the fourth dimension, a teaching tool, and a research object bringing together
     many branches of mathematics and physics connected to the structure of symmetry.</p>
   <p>The sculpture, which measures about six feet in every direction, presents
     the three-dimensional "shadow" of a four-dimensional solid object.  "Although
     mathematicians can work with a fourth dimension abstractly by adding a fourth
     coordinate to the three that we use to describe a point in space, a fourth
     spatial dimension is difficult to visualize," Ocneanu explains.  "The sculpture
     was designed with a new method which captures four dimensional symmetry
     better than anything done before."

The Octacube was produced by the staff of the Engineering Services Shop, managed
by <strong>Jerry
Anderson</strong>.  "It is rare that we get a chance to produce something so
extraordinary for people to enjoy," Jerry Anderson says. "The Octacube demonstrates
the high level of skill and craftsmanship of the Penn State people who transformed
it from a design to an object, including <strong>Janet
Page</strong>, <strong>James Kustenborder</strong>, <strong>Ronald
Weaver</strong>, <strong>Brian Bennett</strong>, <strong>Dennis
Praskovich</strong>, <strong>Thomas Coakley</strong>, <strong>Thomas
Rimmey</strong> and <strong>Lee Brooks</strong>."

Jill Grashof Anderson says she hopes the sculpture will encourage students, faculty,
administrators, alumnae, and friends to ponder and appreciate the world of mathematics.  "I
also hope that all who view the sculpture will begin to grasp the sobering fact
that everyone is vulnerable to something terrible happening to them and that
we all must learn to live one day at a time, making the very best of what has
been given to us.&quot; She adds, "It would be great if everyone who views the
Octacube walks away with the feeling that being kind to others is a good way
to live."</p>

   <p><span class="bodysmall">13 October 2005&mdash;</span>Artistic works traditionally carry significance beyond
     their physical beauty, but a new sculpture in the McAllister Building headquarters
     of the <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State</a> <a href="http://www.math.psu.edu">Department
     of Mathematics</a> may carry that tradition to
     its limits. The stainless-steel work, a striking object of visual art, also
     is a mental portal to the fourth dimension, a teaching tool, a memorial

     of 11 September 2001. The sculpture itself measures about six feet in every
     direction and is mounted on a granite base about three feet high in order
     to bring its center approximately to eye level.</p>
   <p>The sculpture, designed by <strong>Adrian Ocneanu</strong>, professor of mathematics at
     Penn State, presents a three-dimensional &quot;shadow&quot; of a four-dimensional
     solid object. Ocneanu's research involves mathematical models for quantum
     field theory based on symmetry. One aspect of his work is modeling regular
     solids, both mathematically and physically. In the three-dimensional world,
     there are five regular solids--tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron,
     and icosahedron--whose faces are composed of triangles, squares, or pentagons.
     In four dimensions, there are six regular solids, which can be built based
     on the symmetries of the three-dimensional solids. Unfortunately, humans
     cannot process information in four dimensions directly because we don't
     see the universe that way. Although mathematicians can work with a fourth
     dimension abstractly by adding a fourth coordinate to the three that we
     use to describe a point in space, a fourth spatial dimension is difficult
     to visualize. For that, we need models. &quot;Four-dimensional models are
     useful for thinking about and finding new relationships and phenomena,&quot; says
     Ocneanu. &quot;The process is actually quite simple--think in one dimension
     less.&quot; To explain this concept, he points to a map. While the Earth
     is a three-dimensional object, its surface can be represented on a flat
     two-dimensional map.</p>

     <p class="caption">Dr. Ocneanu, pictured at the inauguration of the Octacube, sharing his first apparition of the octacube as a wire model.</p></div><p>Ocneanu's sculpture similarly maps the four-dimensional solid into a space
     perceptible to the human observer. His process, radial stereography, presents
     a new way of making this projection. He explains the process by analogy
     to mapping a globe of the Earth onto a flat surface. &quot;We place a light
     bulb at the north pole of the Earth and we project onto a sheet of paper
     placed underneath it,&quot; he says. &quot;The southern hemisphere, away
     from the north pole, will remain quite small, while the northern hemisphere,
     near the projection pole, will become very big and north pole itself will
     be sent toward infinity.&quot; The technique can be used to make a two-dimensional
     projection of a cube by first mapping the cube radially onto the surface
     of a globe. Ocneanu explains, &quot;The edges of our cube become circles
     on the map, just like straight highways are slightly curved on maps of the
     Earth. Its angles, however, remain true in this projection, so the map retains
     the key aspects of the symmetry of the original cube, unlike a photograph
     of a cube.&quot;</p>
   <p>When the same technique is applied to project a four-dimensional solid
     into three dimensions, the inner part of the projection--equivalent to the
     south pole on the map--has smaller, undistorted faces, while the outer part
     extends toward infinity. Linear edges of the solid become circles in the
     projection. However, the projection is conformal, which means that the angles
     between faces and the way that the faces meet at corners are uniform throughout
     the projection. The retention of these key characteristics makes the sculpture
     a powerful teaching tool in addition to a powerful aesthetic object. &quot;When
     I saw the actual sculpture, I had quite a shock,&quot; says Ocneanu. &quot;I
     never imagined the play of light on the surfaces. There are subtle optical
     effects that you can feel but can't quite put your finger on.&quot; The
     sculpture has significance in several areas of mathematics related to the
     study of symmetry, and it can represent structures that are fundamental
     to many branches of mathematics and physics.</p>

   &quot;The sculpture is a new way to represent a classical mathematical
     object,&quot; says <strong>Nigel Higson</strong>, head of the Penn State Department of Mathematics. &quot;For
     professionals the sculpture is very rich in meaning, but it also has an
     aesthetic appeal that anyone can appreciate. In addition, it helps to start
     conversations about abstract mathematical concepts--something that is generally
     hard to do with anyone other than another expert.&quot;</p>
   <p>The subject of the projection is a regular 4-dimensional solid of intermediate
     complexity, which Ocneanu calls an &quot;octacube.&quot; It has 24 vertices,
     96 edges, and 96 triangular faces, which enclose 24 three-dimensional &quot;rooms.&quot; Windows
     cut in faces allow the viewer to see within the structure, the same way
     that a window in a cubic room opens to the inside of the cube. Physically,
     the sculpture is a giant puzzle of 96 triangular pieces cut from stainless
     steel and bent into spherical shape. Ocneanu attributes the success of the
     project to the machinists and welders of Penn State's <a href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/ess/">Engineering
     Services Shop</a>, managed by <strong>Jerry Anderson</strong>. &quot;It turned out much better than I could
     have imagined,&quot; Ocneanu says. &quot;It's very hard to make 12 steel
     sheets meet perfectly--and conformally--at each of the 23 vertices, with
     no trace of welding left. The people who built it are really world-class
     experts and perfectionists--artists in steel.&quot;</p>
   <p>The sculpture was sponsored by Jill Grashof Anderson, a 1965 graduate of
     the mathematics department, who provided funds for its development and construction.
     It is dedicated to the memory of her husband, <strong>Kermit
     Anderson</strong>--also a 1965
     mathematics graduate--who was killed in the World Trade Center terrorist
     attack on 11 September 2001. She also has sponsored a scholarship in his
     memory. &quot;I hope that the sculpture will encourage students, faculty,
     administrators, alumnae, and friends to ponder and appreciate the wonderful
     world of mathematics,&quot; says Anderson. &quot;I also hope that all who
     view the sculpture will begin to grasp the sobering fact that everyone is
     vulnerable to something terrible happening to them and that we all must
     learn to live one day at a time, making the very best of what has been given
     to us. It would be great if everyone who views the Octacube walks away with
     the feeling that being kind to others is a good way to live.&quot;</p>

     <span class="bodyXlarge"><strong>Facts About the Octacube Sculpture</strong></span><br />
     <em>Written by Adrian Ocneanu, October 2005</em></p>
   <p><em><a href="OctacubeFacts.pdf">Click here to download a PDF of this article. </a></em></p>
   <p><strong>Location<br />
   </strong>The sculpture is on public display in the lobby
     of the Mathematics Department in the McAllister building, between the HUB
     and the Old Main in the central part of the Pennsylvania State University
     campus.</p>
   <p><strong>Mapping</strong><br /> The sculpture represents a three dimensional map of the surface
     of a four dimensional regular solid. Adrian Ocneanu developed and copyrighted
     the map, called windowed radial stereographic projection. The projection
     is the first good method for representing four dimensional solids as it
     shows the 2d walls of the 3d rooms, not only their 1d scaffolding. The edge
     and corner angles between walls and are all equal, preserving the 4d symmetry
     of the model. </p>
   <p>The Earth is 3-dimensional and we can make a map of its surface on a 2
     dimensional sheet of paper. In a similar way in one dimension higher, the
     sculpture represents a map in our 3-dimensional space of the surface of
     a 4-dimensional body. On a map of the Earth the countries are 2d polygons,
     in the sculpture they are 3d rooms, so the sculpture is similar to an apartment
     building. Windows are cut into the walls before the projection, making the
     inner rooms of the sculpture visible.</p>
   <p>On a map of the 3d Earth the angles between roads are maintained, while
     the scale of the map varies in order to stretch the surface of the sphere
     on a sheet - a map with these properties is called conformal in mathematics.
     A good conformal map is the stereographic projection, in which a light bulb
     is placed at the north pole and the shadow of the globe surface is taken
     on a sheet underneath the south pole. The southern hemisphere remains small
     in the middle of the map while the northern hemisphere, close to the projection
     pole, becomes big and surrounds the center of the map. If the initial object
     is not spherical, it is first radially projected on the surface of a sphere
     surrounding it, with a light bulb placed in the center of the sphere.</p>
   <p>The surface of the 4-dimensional solid represented by the sculpture is
     first projected radially on a sphere and then stereographically in our 3d
     world which plays the role of a flat map. The stereographic projection is
     conformal in any dimension, and explains why the angles between walls and
     at the corners are constant throughout the sculpture. The inner part of
     the sculpture, image of the southern hemisphere, is small while the outer
     part imaging the northern hemisphere near the projection pole is large.
     A vertex of the octacube is actually located on the projection pole, so
     the walls surrounding it are cut half way to the pole and their large shadows
     give the outer legs of the sculpture extending toward infinity.</p>
   <p>As a consequence of the symmetry preserved in the sculpture, the reflection
     in the flat faces of the front of the sculpture matches the parts behind,
     thus giving the stainless steel the feeling of transparency.</p>
   <p><strong>Name</strong><br /> The sculpture is titled &quot;Octacube&quot; as its 24 vertices
     consist of the 16 vertices of the 4 dimensional cube, also known as hypercube
     or tesseract, together with the centers of its 8 rooms, which form the vertices
     of the 4d octahedron.</p>
   <p><strong>Construction</strong><br /> 
     Adrian Ocneanu wrote the software which gave the cutting
     instructions for 1/8&quot; stainless steel sheets to the machines in the
     Penn State Engineering Shop. The machinists then worked for almost a year
     to bend into spherical shapes and weld the 96 triangular pieces which meet
     in a giant puzzle, 12 at each of the 23 vertices of the sculpture - the
     24th vertex is at infinity. The sculpture measures 6 x 6 x 6 ft and weighs
     1200 lbs.</p>
   <p><strong>Financing</strong><br /> 
     The sculpture is a gift from Jill Anderson in memory of her
     husband Kermit killed in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, &quot;Lest
     we forget.&quot;</p>
   <p><strong>Mathematical structures</strong><br /> 
     The sculpture was chosen because it encodes more
     mathematical structures in different branches of mathematics and physics
     than any other 4 dimensional object. It starts as a map of the 3d surface
     of the 4th of the 6 four dimensional regular solids, called the octacube,
     which has 24 vertices, 96 edges, 96 triangular faces and 24 octahedral 3d
     rooms.</p>
   <p>As the angles between any two walls are 120&ordm;, and the walls are spherical
     or flat, the rooms of the sculpture could be in principle realized as soap
     bubbles, and are described mathematically as minimal surfaces.</p>
   <p>The vertices of the sculpture are the centers of the 24 spheres which can
     surround a sphere in 4 dimensions, in a very tight pattern possible only
     in dimensions 2,4, 8 and 24. Five of these spheres intersect the sculpture
     base on circles which are engraved in the granite surface of the base. Sphere
     packings are important in number theory and cryptography.<br />
       <br />
       The nodes and mid 3d rooms of the sculpture encode the rotational symmetries
       of a usual cube. Each point V encodes a rotation of angle alpha around
       the axis OV with the length OV equal to the tangent of alpha/4. The vertices
       vertices of a cube are divided according to parity into 2 tetrahedra.
       Rotations of the cube which send each of these tetrahedra into itself
       encode the vertices of the octacube. Rotations of the cube which switch
       the two tetrahedra encode the mid rooms of the octacube.</p>
   <p>The vertices of the sculpture encode also a crystallographic structure
     called a root system of type D4 which describes how to build a higher dimensional
     symmetry group from 24 two dimensional components located at the vertices
     of the sculpture, in a branch of mathematics called Lie groups and algebras.
     Vertices are arranged 6 on each of the 12 circles and 4 lines of the sculpture,
     with each segment of a circle or line representing an angle of 60&ordm; of
     a circle in 4d, and with vertices not on the same circle being perpendicular
     to each other. Using in addition to the 24 vertices of the sculpture also
     part or all of the 24 mid room points, one obtains the same way the crystallographic
     root systems of type B4, C4 and F4.</p>
   <p>Finally the symmetry structure called inversion in the unit sphere between
     the inner half and the outer half of the sculpture can be used to explain
     the relation between spin 1/2 and spin 1 structures in mathematical physics.</p>
