<P align=center>RIEMANN’S ROOTS</P>
<P align=justify>In December 1822, C.F. Gauss submitted a paper to the Royal 
Society of Science in Copenhagen titled, "General Solution of the Problem: To 
Map a Part of a Given Surface on another Given Surface so that the Image and the 
Original are Similar in their Smallest Parts". </P>
<P align=justify>Notably, the paper contained the motto: "Ab his via sternitur 
ad maiora" ("These results pave the way to bigger things"). </P>
<P align=justify>They did. Nearly 30 years later (1851), B. Riemann submitted, 
to Gauss, his doctoral dissertation on functions of a complex variable, which, 
along with his 1857 works on Abelian functions and the Hypergeometric series, 
developed the further implications of the method Gauss had initiated. The deeper 
epistemological implications of these results, however, were only brought to 
light in our present time, through Lyndon LaRouche's discoveries in the science 
of physical economy, as in his most recent work, "On Visualizing the Complex 
Domain". Therein is established the highest vantage point from which to re-live 
the discoveries of Gauss and Riemann. </P>
<P align=justify>Initially, the Royal Society had posed a more limited subject 
for the so-called "Copenhagen Prize Essay" than the one ultimately addressed by 
Gauss. The original question was directed toward solving some particular 
problems involved in the production of geographical maps. At the suggestion of 
his collaborator, the astronomer H.C. Schumacher, Gauss proposed the more 
general question to the Royal Society. After several years without anyone 
providing a serious solution to the question he posed, Gauss submitted his own 
solution, and, of course, was awarded the prize. </P>
<P align=justify>Obviously, Gauss was less interested in winning the prize than 
taking the opportunity to present the more general results he had been 
developing his whole life, beginning with his earliest work on the division of 
the circle and the fundamental theorem of algebra. The Royal Society's challenge 
afforded Gauss the opportunity to demonstrate the extension of Leibniz' 
calculus, under the concept of the complex domain that Gauss had developed in 
those earlier works. While this application provided the solution to the more 
limited practical problem of producing accurate maps, as Gauss indicated, it was 
really about something much more fundamental: specifically, the improvement in 
the capacity of the mind to grasp and communicate truths concerning the unsensed 
principles that govern the universe.</P>
<P align=center><strong>Mapping the Sensorium</strong></P>
<P align=justify>The roots of Gauss' method go deep into the history of 
Mankind's efforts to increase its power in and over nature, beginning with the 
earliest attempts to map sense perceptual space- time by the development of 
calendars and geographical and astronomical maps. These maps expressed not 
merely the visible changes of the heavenly bodies. The unsensed principles were 
reflected as well, in the form of anomalies, paradoxes, and distortions. Thus, 
each map already implies another map that lies "behind', so to speak, the 
visible map. </P>
<P align=justify>Members of the LaRouche Youth Movement currently involved in 
observing the motion of Mars, are confronting the types of paradoxes that arise 
from the development of such maps. Go out and look at Mars rising in the eastern 
sky. The arrangement of the visual image of Mars and the surrounding stars on 
the inside of the celestial sphere gives rise to a mental image, i.e., map. Over 
the course of the night, the motion of Mars and the stars, relative to the 
observer, changes, forming a succession of mental images, which gives rise to a 
map of the changes in the night's succession of maps, or, in other words, a map 
of maps. From night to night, the image of Mars changes its relationship with 
respect to the images of the other stars. This change gives rise to a higher 
map, formed from each night's map of maps. This map of maps of maps gives rise 
to an even higher type of map, a map that reflects the underlying principles 
governing the changes among the maps of the sense perceptual images. This higher 
map only becomes fully intelligible from the standpoint of Gauss' and Riemann's 
complex domain. </P>
<P align=justify>While these investigations are most ancient, the roots of our 
  modern knowledge begin with Thales' (624-547 B.C.) effort to map the celestial 
  sphere onto a plane by the gnomonic, or central projection. Thales' method was 
  to define on the plane, the image of every point on the sphere, by drawing a 
  line from the center of the sphere, through the surface, until that line intersected 
  the image plane. <A 
href="part48_files/part48figure01.gif">(See Figure 1.) </A>(The same result can 
  be demonstrated physically by using a light source located at the center of 
  a transparent hemisphere to cast shadows of figures drawn on the sphere onto 
  a flat wall.)</P>

<P align=justify>This projection immediately presents us with a crucial paradox. 
Certain relationships among the images on the sphere are different than the 
relationships among their images on the plane. For example, the image of a 
spherical triangle whose vertices are three stars on the celestial sphere, is a 
rectilinear triangle on the plane. Consequently, the angular relationship among 
the three stars cannot be preserved in the image, for the sum of the angles of a 
spherical triangle is always greater than 180 degrees, while the sum of the 
angles of a plane triangle is always equal to 180 degrees. </P>
<P align=justify>However, the measurable relationships among the images of the 
stars on the celestial sphere are determined by angular measurements, which are 
not accurately represented by Thales' gnomonic projection. The first solution to 
this problem is attributed to Hipparchus (160-125 B.C.), to whom is attributed 
the discovery of the stereographic projection. In this projection, the sphere is 
mapped onto the plane from one of its poles. <A 
href="part48_files/part48figure02.gif">(See Figure 2.) </A>(This can be 
demonstrated physically by moving the light source in the previous experiment 
from the center of the sphere to its pole. Notice the resulting change in the 
relationship among the shadows.) </P>

<P align=justify>In this stereographic projection, the lines of longitude of the 
sphere are transformed into radial lines on the plane. The latitude lines on the 
sphere are transformed into concentric circles. If we think of the point 
touching the plane as the "south" pole, and the point of projection as the 
"north" pole, the circles of latitude in the "southern" hemisphere all map to 
circles inside the circle which is the image of the equator. On the other hand, 
the circles of latitude in the "northern" hemisphere all map outside this 
circle. The radial lines on the plane make the same angles with each other, as 
the longitude lines of which they are images. However, the radii of the 
concentric circles that are images of the circles of latitude, increase 
exponentially, the farther the latitude circles they represent get from the 
"south" pole and the closer they get to the "north" pole. </P>
<P align=justify>In the case of the stereographic projection, the angles among 
the images are preserved. </P>
<P align=justify>Another projection that preserves angles was developed by 
Gerhard Kremer (1512- 1594), otherwise known as Mercator. On the Mercator 
projection, the image of the equator is a straight line, and the images of the 
circles of longitude are perpendicular lines spaced equally along it. The images 
of the circles of latitude are straight lines parallel to the equator, but the 
distance between them increases. <A 
href="part48_files/part48figure03.gif">(See Figure 3.)</A> This is 
because on a sphere the longitude lines get closer together as they approach the 
poles. Consequently, the ratio of the distance along the surface of a sphere for 
a given angle of latitude, to the distance along the surface for the same angle 
of longitude, changes from the equator to the poles. <A 
href="part48_files/part48figure04.gif">(See Figure 4.)</A> This change is 
reflected in the Mercator projection by increasing the distance between the 
lines of latitude so that the proportion between the lengths of latitude and 
longitude is the same as on the sphere. </P>

<P align=justify>The Mercator projection, although entirely different than the 
stereographic, also preserves angles. It also has the characteristic that the 
so-called rhumb line, or path that makes the same angle with all lines of 
longitude, is a straight line. This exemplifies the types of paradoxes that 
emerge, for the straight-line is the shortest path on the flat plane of the 
projection. But on the sphere, the shortest path is a great circle, and the 
rhumb line is a spiral path called a loxodrome, which is longer than the great 
circle arc. <A href="part48_files/part48figure05.gif">(See Figure 
5.)</A></P>

<P align=center><B>The Mapping of Principles</B></P>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Thus, at first glance, the development of these 
angle-preserving projections (a characteristic that Gauss would later call, 
"conformal"), has a very important significance for the representation of the 
images of the Sensorium. Nevertheless, Gauss had something much more significant 
in mind. The distortions and paradoxes that result from these projections are 
not only due to the visual representation, but reflected something "behind" the 
visible. By developing a general means for transforming one surface into another 
conformally, Gauss paved the way for Riemann's more general investigations into 
the nature of these transformations themselves, and their relationship to the 
underlying principles behind the Sensorium. </P>
<P align=justify>To do this, Gauss rejected the reactionary, a priori 
Euclideanism of Kant. For him a "surface" is not an object embedded in empty 
Euclidean space that is infinitely extended in three directions. Rather, a 
"surface" is generated by some physical action. For example, we don't measure 
the celestial sphere by two angles. The celestial sphere is a physically 
determined idea, generated by the physical action of rotation with respect to 
the direction of the pull of gravity, and the direction around the horizon from 
some physically determined direction, such as the position of the rising (or 
setting) Sun. </P>
<P align=justify>In Riemann's terms, these two acts of rotation are the physical 
modes of determination of the celestial sphere. Were these modes of 
determination created by some other physical action, they would produce a 
different surface. This is the basis for a physically determined geometry. The 
transformation of one surface into another, Gauss demonstrated, is accomplished 
by finding a function that transforms one pair of modes of determination into 
another. </P>
<P align=justify>This is exactly what takes place in a stereographic projection. 
The two modes of determination, represented as circles of latitude and longitude 
on the sphere, are transformed into concentric circles and radial lines, 
respectively, on the plane. In the Mercator projection, the same two modes of 
determination of the sphere, are transformed differently, that is, into straight 
lines. Nevertheless, both projections are conformal. Thus, the characteristic of 
conformality reflects a more general principle, not specific to a particular 
projection. </P>
<P align=justify>Gauss recognized that for a projection to be conformal, it must 
transform one surface into another equally in all directions. This is expressed 
geometrically by the fact that the images of circles are also circles. This can 
be illustrated physically in two ways. Think of an image on a stretchable, say, 
rubber, surface. If the surface is stretched proportionally in all directions, 
then the shape of the image will be the same, only larger. If it is stretched by 
a different amount in different directions, the image will be distorted. The 
former, represents a conformal transformation, the latter, non-conformal. </P>
<P align=justify>Another physical example has been pointed out in previous 
pedagogicals. Take a clear plastic hemisphere and tape to it circles of 
differing sizes, around what would represent a circle of latitude on a sphere. 
Shine a light from the center of the hemisphere. Look at the shadows. The 
circles are transformed into ellipses. Now, move the light to the pole. The 
shadows become more circular, with the shadows of the smaller circles being the 
most circular. This illustrates the difference between the gnomonic projection 
and the stereographic. In the former, the circles are stretched differently in 
different directions, thus producing ellipses. As such, this projection is 
non-conformal. In the latter, the circles are stretched into circles, i.e., they 
are conformal. </P>
<P align=justify>This characteristic of circular action, Gauss had already 
developed as the principle of complex numbers, as early as 1796, in his 
discovery of the division of the circle, and his 1797 fundamental theorem of 
algebra (published in 1799). That is, a complex number, Gauss showed, was not 
arbitrarily defined as the solution to an algebraic equation. Rather, the 
complex number expressed that rotational action, which transcended, and thus 
determined, all possible algebraic magnitudes. The transformation of one complex 
number into another, therefore, was the transformation of one rotational action 
into another rotational action, exactly the condition necessary for the mapping 
to be conformal. </P>
<P align=justify>For this reason, Gauss considered not the visible surface, but 
its representation in the complex domain. Each point on the surface corresponded 
to a complex number, which in turn was determined by the physical modes of 
determination of the surface. To transform one surface onto another, required 
transforming the modes of determination of one surface into the modes of 
determination of the other, which in turn transformed each complex number of the 
first surface into a definite complex number of the second. This is what Riemann 
would later call, "a function of a complex variable." </P>

<P align=justify>This was illustrated above by the examples of the stereographic 
and Mercator projections. In the former case, the circles of latitude and 
longitude that were equally spaced around the sphere were transformed into 
exponentially spaced concentric circles and radial lines on the plane. Gauss 
notes that this corresponds geometrically to the transformation of the complex 
exponential. <A href="part48_files/part48figure06.gif">(See Figure 
6.)</A> The Mercator projection corresponds to a transformation of the 
stereographic projection. <A href="part48_files/part48figure07.gif">(See 
Figure 7.)</A> To map a sphere onto a plane, Gauss applied these complex 
transformations, to the modes of determination of a sphere, that is, the two 
modes of rotation. </P>

<P align=justify>In his paper, Gauss demonstrated why these types of projections 
would be conformal. This can be illustrated geometrically, by looking at the 
behavior of a small square undergoing the desired transformation. As the 
accompanying <A href="part48_files/part48animation01.gif">animation 
</A>illustrates, in order for the diagonals of the square to remain 
perpendicular, the sides of the square must change accordingly. Gauss expressed 
this geometric condition by a formula in the language of Leibniz' calculus, 
which was restated by Riemann in his doctoral dissertation. It is one of the 
continuing frauds of modern mathematics, that this formula has become known as 
the "Cauchy-Riemann" formula, despite the fact that Augustin Louis Cauchy added 
nothing to its development. For the sake of historical accuracy, and mental 
health, this relationship should really be known as the Gauss-Riemann 
relationship.</P>

<P align=center>Still Lurking Behind the Scenes</P>
</B>
<P align=justify>Within Gauss' discovery, something is lurking behind the scenes, 
  a spirit from the domain of unseen principles. In both the above examples, the 
  projection becomes increasingly distorted-- as the projection approaches the 
  north pole in the case of the stereographic, and as the projection approaches 
  both poles in the case of the Mercator. At the poles, the projection "blows 
  up" completely and ceases to exist. Is this just a failing in the projection, 
  or, is this an indication of some yet unknown, hidden principle? </P>
<P align=justify>In this question lay the "bigger things" for which Gauss paved 
  the way.</P>
